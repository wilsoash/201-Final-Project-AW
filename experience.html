                        <h2 class="section-heading">Experience</h2>
                        <p>My professional experiences have provided a foundation for me to grow in all aspects of life. From education, to employment, to internships and volunteering, these experiences continue to influence my outlook and my ability to push myself to achieve greatness.</p>
                        <p>I have worked at BYU Law in External Relations for two years and will continue there following graduation as the Communication Coordinator. I have planned events, managed fundraising efforts, and assisted the Dean with all necessary projects.</p>
                        <p>While at BYU, I was also a Research Assistant for Dr. Hawkins and the Impact Evidence Team. I read and coded academic articles and interviewed Latin American Bureaucrats about democracy.</p>

                        <p>I was the marketing and community relations intern for By Women, For Women. I planned online events, managed social media, and supervised the membership program.</p>
                        <p>These professional experiences have allowed me to stretch myself and grow personally and professionally.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Volunteer</h2>
                        <p>My volunteer experience has been equally rewarding, maybe even more, in providing a foundation for growth.</p>
                        <p>I spent a year and a half volunteering for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a full time missionary in Sonora, Mexico and North Dakota. This experience taught me an appreciation for different cultures and for service to my fellow human being.</p>

                        <p>I currently volunteer for BWFW as the Secretary to the Board. In this role I have come to appreciate the influence of women, especially in Europe, as we work to encourage and uplift women's voices and inspire courage.</p>
                        <p>My combination of professional and volunteer experience has provided a unique and important foundation for me and my life. These experiences have taught me that there is always good to do in the world.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Future</h2>
                        <p>Looking toward the future, I have many aspirations for myself. I want to use my unique experiences and skillset to make a difference in the world. </p>

                        <p>My current career aspirations are to work in the international field, specifically concerning relations between the United States and Latin America. In the next few years I plan to move to Washington, D.C. and enter that field.</p>
                        <p>Another important part of my life is volunteering for a cause I believe in. I will continue with my interest in non-profit management and find ways to give back to my community.</p>
                        <p>As I graduate, I look forward to entering the world and finding my place and my purpose in it as a woman of faith.</p>
